    <p> Basketball is my favorite sport. I really enjoy it I play it a lot and I also play the virtual game nba 2k21. They are coming out with a 2k22 soon if your intrested but anyways here are some facts about basketball. 1. Asked in 1891 to invent an indoor winter activity by his boss at a YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts, James Naismith is credited as the founder of basketball. Naismith, a physical education teacher, also wrote the original basketball rule book and founded the University of Kansas basketball program.  2. As bizarre as it sounds, basketball was originally played with a soccer ball and peach baskets, with referees having to retrieve the ball each time a player made a basket. In 1900, the string baskets we know today were introduced to the game and, later, backboards were attached to prevent spectators from blocking a shot.   3. Players never could advance the ball. Instead, each player had to throw it from wherever he caught it. The first team credited with advancing the ball by dribbling it played at Yale in 1897, and the official allowance for the dribble, just one per possession at first, were adopted four years later. All those facts were crazy right? If you enjoyed this paragraph maybe you should start playing basketball or atleast try!
